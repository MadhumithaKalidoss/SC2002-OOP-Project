The Camp Application and Management System (CAMs) is an application for staff and students to manage, view and register for camps within NTU. The application will act as a centralised hub for all staff and students.
We employ array lists to organise and store all camp information, suggestions and enquiries. User data from an Excel file, encompassing names, emails, and faculty details, is organised into role-specific array lists. During this process, user IDs are also assigned, and passwords are securely stored into the array lists.
The utilisation of array lists alongside secure user data handling reinforces the system's efficiency, and organisation in managing camp-related functionalities and user interactions.
Additionally, the application features a main application class for login and tailored menus for the different user groups, ensuring seamless navigation and access to specific functionalities, thereby enhancing overall usability.
